Theory quesꢀons

\1) Menꢀon the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end

Divisions

Ans) Front end:-

1\.It is interacꢀon between user and server.

2\.When user sends requests to server.

3\.Server give its response in form of webpage.

4\.Interacꢀon between user and webpage occurs via browser.

5\.For example if user types www.google.com in browser server receives it

and sends google webpage as response.

6\.We use HTML,CSS,Javascript to create front page.

Back end:-

1\.It is interacꢀon between server and database.

2\.When server search in database for data.

3\.Database give required data which is called fetching data from database.

4\.We use SQL,MongoDB,React e.t.c to create backend soꢁware.

\2) What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example\.

Ans)Tags:-

Tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets like <html>.

These are structures of HTML .Some of their categories are:-

1\. Heading Tags:

Heading tags deﬁne headings or ꢀtles on a web page. They range from <h1> to

<h6>, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest.

Example:<h1> HELLO WORLD </h1> prints hello world as heading



<a name="br2"></a> 

2 )Paragraph Tags:-

Paragraph tags deﬁne paragraphs of text. They are represented by the <p> tag.

Example:-<p> This is para </p>

\3) Image Tags:

Image tags display images on a web page. They are represented by the <img>

tag and require a "src" aꢂribute specifying the image URL.

Example: <img src=image.png alt=”not available”> it paste applied imager and

image is not present then alt will show

4)List Tags:

List tags are used to create ordered and unordered lists. <ul> represents an

unordered list (bulleted), and <ol> represents an ordered list (numbered).

Example: <ul>

<li>Idly</li>

<li>Vada</li>

<li>Sambar</li>

</ul> prints above list in bullet form.

5)Table Tags:

Table tags are used to create tables on a web page. They consist of the <table>

tag for the table itself, <tr> for table rows, <th> for table headers, and <td> for

table data.

Example: <table>

<tr>

<th>Name</th>

<th>Designaꢀon</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Rohith</td>



<a name="br3"></a> 

<td>Student</td>

</tr>

</table>

\3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM\.

Ans)1. The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in web development

frameworks like React to improve performance and opꢀmize updates to the

user interface.

2\.When you create a user interface in React or a similar framework, the iniꢀal

render creates a virtual representaꢀon of the UI known as the Virtual DOM. It's

a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

3\.Once the Virtual DOM is created, it needs to be rendered onto the actual

browser DOM so that it can be displayed to the user. This iniꢀal rendering

creates the actual HTML elements and inserts them into the DOM.

4\. The Virtual DOM is a tree-like structure composed of virtual elements, which

are JavaScript objects represenꢀng the HTML elements. Each virtual element

corresponds to a real DOM element.

\4) Menꢀon some Diﬀerences between MySQL and No SQL

Ans)MySQL:-

1\. It follows a structured, tabular data model with predeﬁned schemas and

ﬁxed tables. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for deﬁning and

manipulaꢀng the data.

2\. It typically scales verꢀcally, meaning it requires more powerful hardware

or a larger server to handle increased loads.

3\. It requires a predeﬁned schema, meaning the structure of the data must

be deﬁned before storing it. Modifying the schema can be challenging

and may require altering exisꢀng data.

4\. It provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolaꢀon, Durability) properꢀes,

ensuring data consistency and integrity. It supports transacꢀons that

guarantee all or nothing operaꢀons.

NOSQL:-



<a name="br4"></a> 

1\. It employs a ﬂexible, schema-less data model. There are various types of

NoSQL databases, including document-oriented, key-value, columnar,

and graph databases.

2\. NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they

can distribute data across mulꢀple servers, making them highly scalable

and able to handle large amounts of data and traﬃc.

3\. It oﬀers more ﬂexibility in terms of schema evoluꢀon. It allows for

dynamic and ﬂexible schema changes, making it easier to adapt to

evolving applicaꢀon requirements.

4\. NoSQL databases may have varying levels of support for ACID

transacꢀons. Some NoSQL databases prioriꢀze scalability over strict

transacꢀonal guarantees, providing eventual consistency instead.

\5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words

Ans) One of DBMS technology is MongoDB

1\. MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a

ﬂexible and scalable soluꢀon for managing and storing data.

2\. In MongoDB, data is organized and stored as documents, which are

similar to JSON objects

3\. MongoDB allows for dynamic and ﬂexible schemas, meaning each

document within a collecꢀon can have its own unique structure.

4\. MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for distribuꢀng data

across mulꢀple servers or clusters.

5\. MongoDB provides a powerful and expressive query language for

retrieving and manipulaꢀng data.
